## Creating Your Own Plugins

We encourage developers to write their own plugins. Please refer to the "Getting Started" documentation to learn how to create a plugin for the app.

- We encourage you to make your plugin open-source, although it's not mandatory.

## Contributing to Core

**We are currently not accepting contributions to the core.**

The core is currently licensed under the FUTO Temporary License (FTL). The licensing and ownership of contributions to the core are complex topics that we are still working on. We'll update these guidelines when we have more clarity.
